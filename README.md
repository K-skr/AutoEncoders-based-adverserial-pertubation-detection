# Autoencoders-based Adversarial Perturbation Detection in Machine Learning Systems Using Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project implements an autoencoder-based adversarial perturbation detection system in machine learning models using transfer learning techniques. The system aims to detect adversarial perturbations in input data by leveraging pre-trained autoencoders. Transfer learning helps enhance the model's performance in detecting such anomalies with minimal training data.

## Features

- **Autoencoder Architecture**: Uses deep autoencoders to reconstruct inputs and detect perturbations by calculating reconstruction errors.
- **Transfer Learning**: Pre-trained models are fine-tuned to accelerate training and improve performance on adversarial examples.
- **Adversarial Attack Detection**: Detects adversarial examples generated by various attack techniques (FGSM, PGD, etc.).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Reports key metrics such as reconstruction error, detection accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Customizable Model**: Flexible architecture that allows fine-tuning of autoencoder layers and transfer learning parameters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (choose the one applicable for your implementation)
- CUDA (for GPU acceleration)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experimentation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/autoencoder-adversarial-detection.git
    cd autoencoder-adversarial-detection
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Download Dataset**: 
   You can use any dataset for the detection task, such as the MNIST, CIFAR-10, or ImageNet dataset, depending on the scope. Ensure the dataset is available in the `data/` directory.
   
4. **Prepare Data**:
    Prepare your dataset for training and testing by splitting into clean and adversarial examples. Preprocess them as needed using the utility functions.

### Training the Autoencoder

1. **Pre-train Autoencoder**:
   Use transfer learning by loading a pre-trained autoencoder model and fine-tune it on your dataset.

    ```bash
    python train_autoencoder.py --dataset data/ --epochs 50 --batch_size 64 --learning_rate 0.001
    ```

2. **Fine-tuning**:
   If you want to fine-tune the autoencoder for adversarial detection, you can use transfer learning by adjusting the parameters.

    ```bash
    python train_autoencoder.py --pretrained_model models/pretrained_autoencoder.h5 --fine_tune True
    ```

### Evaluating the Model

After training, you can evaluate the model’s performance on clean and adversarial datasets.

1. **Evaluate Performance**:
    ```bash
    python evaluate_model.py --dataset data/test/ --model models/trained_autoencoder.h5
    ```

2. **Metrics**: The evaluation will output key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the reconstruction error for clean and adversarial examples.

### Inference

To detect adversarial perturbations in new data, use the following command:

```bash
python inference.py --input sample_image.png --model models/trained_autoencoder.h5
```

The system will output the detection status (clean or adversarial) based on the reconstruction error threshold.

## Results

The results of the detection system are stored in the `results/` directory, including:

- **Reconstruction Error Plots**: Visualize the reconstruction error to see the separation between clean and adversarial examples.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Shows true positives, false positives, etc.
- **ROC Curve**: Plots the ROC curve for performance analysis.
